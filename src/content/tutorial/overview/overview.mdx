## Introduction

Welcome! This tutorial will guide you in creating a React app with the Carbon Design System. We'll teach you the ins and outs of using Carbon components, while introducing more general web development topics along the way.

## Audience

This tutorial is intended for people that have any amount of web development experience. If you want to jump straight to code, you may want to skip this tutorial and go to the [developers getting started](/getting-started/developers) page.

## Prerequisites

### React

This is a web development tutorial that uses the Carbon React components. If you're just getting started with React, the official React documentation is incredible. If you enjoy learning-by-doing, check out their [intro tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). You'll want to supplement that with their [step-by-step guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html), especially if you prefer learning concepts by reading.

### ES6/ES2015

React apps often use the latest and greatest from JavaScript (ES6/ES2015). You'll want to be up to speed on the most commonly used features of the language. [Let's Learn ES6](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL57atfCFqj2h5fpdZD-doGEIs0NZxeJTX) covers those features in depth.

### GitHub

We'll be using GitHub to build an app together, so if you're new to GitHub, make sure you've [made an account](https://github.com/join). Their [getting started guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world) is a great way to learn GitHub.

## Outline

Each step in this tutorial illustrates a different aspect of developing web applications with Carbon. We recommend starting with step 1, but you can go through any tutorial step by itself.

1. Installing Carbon
1. Building pages
1. Using APIs
1. Creating components
1. Deploying to IBM Cloud
