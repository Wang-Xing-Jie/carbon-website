## Create project

### Set up cloned repo
The first step is to fork and clone the tutorial repo into your own Github.

#### Fork
Fork the carbon tutorial [repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial).

#### Clone
From your forked repo, copy the SSH key or HTTPS url and in your terminal run
```git clone [your fork SSH/HTTPS]```


### Set up upstream
Set up the original repo as an upstream by running the following in your terminal:
```
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial.git
```

 #### Verify origin and upstream
 Verify that you have both your forked repo as the origin and the original `carbon-tutorial` repo as the upstream by running the following command:
```
$ git remote -v 
```

Your terminal should output something like this:
```
origin	[your forked repo] (fetch)
origin	[your forked repo] (push)
upstream	git@github.com:carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial.git (fetch)
upstream	git@github.com:carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial.git (push)
```

## Step 1 branch 
Now that we have our repo set up, let's checkout the branch we'll be working in.

Run the following command to create the branch.
```
$ git checkout react-step-1
```

Now run the tests. You will see failing tests. But don't worry, we will make those tests pass once we set up our app.
```
$ yarn
$ yarn test
```

## Installing Dependencies 
Run `yarn` to install current dependencies.

#### Add Carbon dependencies
Even though we installed existing dependencies, we're still missing a few Carbon packages we'll need.

`carbon-components` is the package that has our styles. We will need to install this to be able to import our styles for our components.
`carbon-components-react` is the package that has the React components that we will use throughout our app.

And lastly `@carbon/icons-react` is part of our new [carbon-elements](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-elements) package. This collection of packages helps developers execute the IBM Design Language in products. There are several packages that we will use, but in the meantime we only need the icons package. 

```
$ yarn add carbon-components carbon-components-react @carbon/icons-react
```

Run `yarn start` to start your server. A browser window should automatically open with your local environment.
```
$ yarn start
```

## Setting up Sass
Run the following command to install `node-sass` as a dependency.
```
$ yarn add node-sass
```

In `src/` rename `index.css` as `index.scss`. Then in `index.js` update the `css` import to `index.scss`.

#### Importing carbon-component styles
In `index.scss` import Carbon styles by adding:
```
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/styles.scss';

```

Next we'll import a `<Button/>` from Carbon to test that our dependencies are working properly. At the top of `src/App.js`, import the `<Button/>` by adding the following:

```
import Button from 'carbon-components-react/lib/components/Button/Button';
``` 

We want to import the exact path of the component in this case. To minimize our import cost, we don't want to import the entire package just for the `Button` component.

In the return, you can now add:
```
<Button>Button</Button>
```

Congratulations, you've imported your first component! You should see a Carbon styled button on the page.

## Adding the UI Shell
_Note: The UI Shell is still experimental at the moment. We do not recommend using it for production until it is stable, but if doing so, know that there may be breaking changes in the future._

If you remember from running `yarn test` at the beginning of this tutorial, our tests are failing from missing a `<TutorialHeader/>` component. We will be creating our `<TutorialHeader/>` component in our `src/components/TutorialHeader` folder.
Start by creating the following files in there:
```
TutorialHeader.js
index.js
tutorial-header.scss
```
These should be a sibling of the `__tests__` folder.

### UI Header Sass
In `index.scss` add the following feature-flag **above** the Carbon styles import like so:

```
$feature-flags: (
  ui-shell: true,
);
```

This is because our UI Shell is still in experimental mode and the styles need to be manually imported.

Next, **below** the Carbon styles import, we'll import our `<TutorialHeader/>` styles. Your file should now look like this:

```
$feature-flags: (
  ui-shell: true,
);


@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/styles.scss';
@import './components/TutorialHeader/tutorial-header.scss';
```

### Importing and Exporting Header
In `src/components/TutorialHeader/index.js`, import and export our `<TutorialHeader/>` component like so:

```
import TutorialHeader from './Header';
export default TutorialHeader;
```

Next we'll import our Carbon UI Shell components into `src/components/TutorialHeader/TutorialHeader.js`. Set up the file like so:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import {
  Header,
  HeaderName,
  HeaderNavigation,
  HeaderMenuItem,
  HeaderGlobalBar,
  HeaderGlobalAction,
  SkipToContent,
} from 'carbon-components-react/lib/components/UIShell';

class TutorialHeader extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <Header aria-label="Carbon Tutorial">
          <SkipToContent />
          <HeaderName href="/" prefix="IBM">
            Carbon Tutorial
          </HeaderName>
          <HeaderNavigation aria-label="Carbon Tutorial">
            <HeaderMenuItem href="/repos">Link 1</HeaderMenuItem>
          </HeaderNavigation>
          <HeaderGlobalBar />
        </Header>
      </>
    );
  }
}

export default TutorialHeader;
```

_Note: you can find a description of the different components used UI Shell in our [carbon-componets-react](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-react/tree/master/src/components/UIShell) repo._

When creating navigation headers, it's important to have a `Skip to content` link for accessibility. This allows keyboard users to skip the navigation items and go straight to the main content.  

Another important thing to notice is that we're using React Fragment to return the header components. This is because we will later be rendering `<TutorialHeader/>` in `App.js` as a sibling of `<Content/>`, which is another UI Shell component. `<Content/>` is meant to be a sibling of the `<Header/>` component that we're returning in `<TutorialHeader/>`. If these two aren't siblings, the `<Content/>` elements will not be rendered directly below the UI shell. By using React Fragment, we're rendering these two components as siblings. Another way to fix this would be to render these in the same file, or offsetting the `<Content/>` margin to be below the UI shell.

### Importing Icons 
Now lets try importing the icons from our `@carbon/icons-react` elements package. In the `TutorialHeader.js` file, we need to import each individual icon we will use.
```
import Notification20 from '@carbon/icons-react/lib/notification/20';
import UserAvatar20 from '@carbon/icons-react/lib/user--avatar/20';
import AppSwitcher20 from '@carbon/icons-react/lib/app-switcher/20';
```

Then we need to add the `<HeaderGlobalAction>` component inside of the `<GlobalHeaderBar>` where we will add our icons. These represent actions in the header a user can make. 

```
<HeaderGlobalBar>
  <HeaderGlobalAction>
    <Notification20 />
  </HeaderGlobalAction>
  <HeaderGlobalAction>
    <UserAvatar20 />
  </HeaderGlobalAction>
  <HeaderGlobalAction>
    <AppSwitcher20 />
  </HeaderGlobalAction>
</HeaderGlobalBar>
```

### Rendering Header

Next we'll render our UI Shell by importing our `<TutorialHeader/>` component and `<Content/>` into `App.js`.
Your imports should look like this:

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Content } from 'carbon-components-react/lib/components/UIShell';
import TutorialHeader from './components/TutorialHeader/TutorialHeader';
```

Our `return` currently just contains a `<Button/>`. Let's update that to include our imported components. This should look like the following:

```
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <TutorialHeader />
        <Content>
		  <Button>Button</Button>
        </Content>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

You should now see a styled UI Shell Header and a button below it.

## Add routing

We've updated our app to render our header, but now we need to add routing functionality. To do this we need to install `react-router-dom`.

```
$ yarn add react-router-dom
```

## Creating our pages
Next thing we need to do is create the files for our content.

Start by creating a folder called `content` in `src/`. This should be a sibling of `src/components`.

Since our app will have two pages, we'll create two folders in `src/content`.
```
src/content/LandingPage
src/content/RepoPage
```

Next we'll set up these folders the same way we set up `src/components/TutorialHeader`.

Create the following files in the `LandingPage` folder:
```
index.js
landing-page.scss
LandingPage.js
```

Create the following files in the `RepoPage` folder:
```
index.js
repo-page.scss
RepoPage.js
```

### Setting up content sass
Next, we'll import our content sass files in `index.scss` *below* our other imports, like so:
```
@import 'carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/styles.scss';
@import './components/TutorialHeader/tutorial-header.scss';
@import './content/LandingPage/landing-page.scss';
@import './content/RepoPage/repo-page.scss';
```

### Importing and exporting content pages
Now that our stylesheets are set up, we need to create our pages' components.
Starting with `<LandingPage/>`, just like with our header, we need to export the component in `src/content/LandingPage/index.js` by adding:

```
import LandingPage from './LandingPage';
export default LandingPage;
```

Next in `src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js` we'll create our component.

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class LandingPage extends Component {
  render() {
    return <div> LANDING PAGE </div>;
  }
}

export default LandingPage;
```

We'll repeat this process with `<RepoPage/>`. 

In `src/content/RepoPage/index.js`, import and export the `<RepoPage/>` component like so:

```
import RepoPage from './RepoPage';
export default RepoPage;
```

Then in `src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js` create the component.

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class RepoPage extends Component {
  render() {
    return <div> REPO PAGE </div>;
  }
}

export default RepoPage;
```

Awesome! We've just created our content pages. Next thing we need to do is render them with our router.


## Rendering content with react-router-dom
In order to render our content pages, we need to add the following imports in `App.js` below our existing imports.

```
import LandingPage from './content/LandingPage/LandingPage';
import RepoPage from './content/RepoPage/RepoPage';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
```

This allows us to use our page content components and routing components from `react-router-dom`, which we installed a few steps back.

Next thing we need to is update what we're returning in `App.js` . We currently just have a button in our content. In order to render our pages correctly, we need to do a few things:

- update the `<div>` that is wrapping all the elements to `<Router>`
- delete the `<Button/>` component within `<Content/>`

Now inside `<Content/>` we'll add the following:
```
<Switch>
  <Route exact path="/" component={LandingPage} />
  <Route path="/repos" component={RepoPage} />
</Switch>
```

We're half way there! Now we need to point our header links to these routes.

In `src/components/TutorialHeader/TutorialHeader.js` we need to update the `href` for `<HeaderName/>` and `<HeaderMenuItem/>`. Because `<HeaderName/>` is our main link "IBM Carbon Tutorial", when a user click this link it should render our `<LandingPage/>` component, so the `href` should be updated to `href="/"` since that's the path we added for it in `App.js`. Our `<HeaderMenuItem/>` will link to our `<RepoPage/>` so the update the `href` to `href="/repos"`.

WOOHOO! You should now have a working header that routes to different pages!

### Running the tests again

Now lets check to see if our tests pass. We have now added the shell so we should see our tests pass.
```
$ yarn test
```
