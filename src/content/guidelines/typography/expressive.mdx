## IBM Expressive theme

The _Expressive_ theme is for use in editorial and digital marketing experiences at IBM. This theme introduces the new IBM Design Language tokens. Please switch to the new tokens wherever possible.

## Expressive type sets

Even though IBM Plex contains a wide range of scales, it’s important to use curated type sets for a clear and focused reading experience.

### Supporting styles

<TypesetStyle
  breakpointControls={false}
  typesets="supportingStyle,body,fixedHeadingExpressive"
/>

## Fluid type sets

Fluid type is applied to large headline and display type styles. We set up fixed type scales at the breakpoints and are fluid in between. This helps us to maintain the quality of typography. Display types (“j” and “k”) are reserved only for graphic/visual elements. These should be used sparingly and thoughtfully within a user journey. It is not suitable for complex messaging, does not need to appear on every page.

<TypesetStyle
  breakpointControls={true}
  typesets="fluidHeading,fluidParagraphQuotation,fluidDisplay"
/>
